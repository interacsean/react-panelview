## Webpack babel es6 React boilerplate

*"Nothing you don't need"*

This is an extremely minimal boilerplate for a webpack es6 React project.

It has only been initialised with webpack-dev-server, and set up for es6 transpiling (using babel-preset-env targetted to IE10).

## Instructions

 - Once cloned, run `npm install` to initialise.
 - `./src/index.js` is your app's entry point.
 - `./static/index.html` is your html template.
 - Put images and other static resources in `./static/`. 
 - To start your app: `npm start`.
 - To package your app: `npm run build`.
 - Find bundled, distributable code in `./dist/`.

DIY css preprocessing, test frameworks.
