## Webpack babel es2015 boilerplate

*Nothing you don't need*

This is an extremely minimal boilerplate for a webpack es6 project.

It has only been initialised with webpack-dev-server, and set up for es6 transpiling (using babel-preset-es2015*).

## Instructions

 - Once cloned, run `npm install` to initialise.
 - `src/app.js` is your app's entry point.
 - `src/index.html` is your base template.
 - To start your app: `npm start`.
 - To package your app: `npm build`.
 - Find bundled, distributable code in `/dist`.

_* I'm opting not to use babel-preset-env, as the straight-forward set up did not include async/await functionality_
